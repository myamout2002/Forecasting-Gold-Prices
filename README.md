# Forecasting
This project focuses on forecasting real-world gold prices 1 year into the future using both simple and exponential smoothing forecasting methods. 
The data was collected from the World Gold Council until February 2025.
Accuracy of models were calculated using the traditional approach of training and test sets as well as using modern methods (cross validation) and a final champion model was selected
The champion model was then implemented to forecast gold prices 1 year into the future.
The forecast, along with its level of uncertainty, were calculated and interpreted.
A comprehensive report was prepared documenting the entire forecasting procedure and results
